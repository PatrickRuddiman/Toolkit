# WriteCommit Project Reorganization

## Overview
Successfully reorganized the WriteCommit project by splitting the monolithic `Program.cs` file into a well-structured, maintainable codebase with proper separation of concerns.

## Project Structure

### Before Reorganization
- **Program.cs** - Single file containing ~680 lines with all classes mixed together:
  - `DiffChunk` class (data model)
  - `SemanticCoherenceAnalyzer` class (business logic)
  - `Program` class (entry point and command-line interface)
  - All Git and Fabric integration code mixed in

### After Reorganization

```
WriteCommit/
├── Models/
│   └── DiffChunk.cs              # Data model for diff chunks
├── Services/
│   ├── SemanticCoherenceAnalyzer.cs  # Git diff analysis and chunking logic
│   ├── FabricService.cs          # Fabric AI integration service
│   └── GitService.cs             # Git operations service
└── Program.cs                    # Clean entry point with dependency injection
```

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. Models/DiffChunk.cs
- **Purpose**: Data model representing a chunk of git diff
- **Namespace**: `WriteCommit.Models`
- **Properties**: FileName, Content, LineCount, ChangeType

### 2. Services/SemanticCoherenceAnalyzer.cs
- **Purpose**: Analyzes git diffs and splits them into semantic chunks
- **Namespace**: `WriteCommit.Services`
- **Key Methods**: 
  - `ChunkDiff()` - Main chunking logic
  - `GroupFilesBySemanticCoherence()` - Groups related files
  - `AreFilesSemanticallySimilar()` - Determines file relationships

### 3. Services/FabricService.cs
- **Purpose**: Handles all interactions with the Fabric AI service
- **Namespace**: `WriteCommit.Services`
- **Key Methods**:
  - `GenerateCommitMessageAsync()` - Main entry point for commit message generation
  - `ProcessSingleChunkAsync()` - Processes individual chunks (uses "summarize" pattern)
  - `CombineChunkMessagesAsync()` - Combines multiple chunk summaries

### 4. Services/GitService.cs
- **Purpose**: Handles all Git operations
- **Namespace**: `WriteCommit.Services`
- **Key Methods**:
  - `IsInGitRepositoryAsync()` - Checks if in git repo
  - `GetStagedChangesAsync()` - Gets staged changes
  - `CommitChangesAsync()` - Commits changes with message

### 5. Program.cs (Refactored)
- **Purpose**: Clean entry point with command-line interface
- **Namespace**: `WriteCommit`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Command-line argument parsing
  - Service instantiation and dependency injection
  - High-level orchestration of the commit message generation process

## Benefits of Reorganization

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- Each class now has a single, well-defined responsibility
- Models handle data structure
- Services handle business logic
- Program handles UI and orchestration

### 2. **Improved Maintainability**
- Easier to locate and modify specific functionality
- Reduced file size makes code more readable
- Clear dependencies between components

### 3. **Better Testability**
- Services can be easily unit tested in isolation
- Dependency injection enables mocking for tests
- Clear interfaces between components

### 4. **Enhanced Modularity**
- Features can be developed and modified independently
- Easier to add new services or modify existing ones
- Better code reusability

### 5. **Cleaner Architecture**
- Follows standard .NET project organization patterns
- Clear namespace organization
- Proper encapsulation of functionality

## Key Implementation Details

### Pattern Usage for Semantic Coherence
- **Individual Chunks**: Uses `"summarize"` pattern for processing each chunk
- **Final Combination**: Uses user-specified pattern (default: `"write_commit_message"`) for final commit message
- This ensures semantic coherence while maintaining the desired output format

### Service Dependencies
- `GitService`: No external dependencies within the project
- `FabricService`: No external dependencies within the project  
- `SemanticCoherenceAnalyzer`: Depends on `WriteCommit.Models.DiffChunk`
- `Program`: Depends on all services and models

### Error Handling
- Each service maintains its own error handling
- Services throw meaningful exceptions that are caught at the Program level
- Consistent error reporting to the user

## Verification
- ✅ Project builds successfully
- ✅ Application runs and displays help correctly
- ✅ All original functionality preserved
- ✅ "Summarize" pattern implementation maintained for chunk processing
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns achieved

## Next Steps
The reorganized codebase is now ready for:
1. Unit testing of individual services
2. Further feature development
3. Performance optimizations
4. Additional service integrations
