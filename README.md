# Toolkit

This repository contains setup scripts.

## Linux Setup

Use `MachineInit/setup.sh gui` for a desktop environment, or `MachineInit/setup.sh server` for headless servers.

You can run the setup directly without cloning:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PatrickRuddiman/Toolkit/main/MachineInit/setup.sh | bash -s -- gui
```

Add wallpapers you want deployed to the `wallpapers` folder.
